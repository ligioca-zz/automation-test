# automation test

Small UI test automation suite for a website.

UC: User can edit phone number information through My profile section.

UC: User can edit clothing size information through My profile section.

Why did you chose this Framework? 
This is the most familiar framework for me.

Why did you chose this Usecase?
Updating user's phone number and clothing size looks very important to contact the user and fill his box correctly, with correct clothes size. One good uc would be send order the box, but not in production invironment.

What would be the next steps?
Update project with correct data, maybe data provider. After include more test cases, run it in a CI.
